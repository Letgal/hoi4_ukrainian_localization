 DEN_refortify_tunestillingen_desc: "The last time Europe was engulfed in war, we prepared our defenses by building Tunestillingen - a series of fortifications to protect København.

 DEN_danske_stalvalsevaerket: "Danske Stålvalseværket"
 DEN_danske_stalvalsevaerket_desc: "Several representatives from the industrial sector have campaigned for an increase in steel production. If we established a new mill, it could be a boost to the economy and make us more self-reliant on steel production."

 DEN_full_social_mobilization_desc: "War is on our doorstep and to secure our freedom we must mobilize every facet of society. Every man, woman, and child must know their duties and obligations.

 DEN_territory_for_protection_desc: "The rearmament program is proceeding according to plan, but there is still doubt in the military that it will suffice.

DEN_assault_troops_desc: "Whilst the army can hold the line and push our foes back little by little, it is through the power of our elite troops in which we will find the power needed to destroy any threat that we face. We should prioritize their training and ensure that we have obedient, disciplined special forces waiting in reserve."
DEN_prioritize_navy: "Prioritize Søværnet"
DEN_prioritize_navy_desc: "The home territories are but a small peninsula, and as such it is of great importance that we prioritize the development of our fleet in waiting.

 DEN_seek_independence: "Seek Independence"

 DEN_sanction_sabotages_desc: "Even though we are cooperating with [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef], that doesn't necessarily mean that we can not resist the occupation in a peaceful manner. One could argue that it is in fact our duty to resist without endangering our people."

 DEN_create_danforce_desc: "[?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDefCap] has forbidden us from having a military large enough to truly threaten their supremacy.

 DEN_strengthen_the_danish_brigades_desc: "We will not be able to amass the same firepower that [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef] has, so we must fight smart and outwit them instead. We must study our enemies and find their weaknesses in order to exploit them on the battlefield."

 DEN_establish_danske_flotille: "Establish Den Danske Flotille"
 DEN_establish_danske_flotille_desc: "By establishing a flotilla in exile, we can train the men and hold naval drills that will sharpen their skills to help in the liberation of our lands.

 DEN_buy_foreign_ships: "Procure Destroyers"
 DEN_buy_foreign_ships_desc: "To secure [DEN.GetNameDef]'s coastline and many islands we must first secure a capable fleet that can protect our sea lanes.

 DEN_ask_for_weapons_desc: "Our [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] overlords keep depleting our weapon and munition stockpiles, crippling our ability to fight back when the day comes to declare our independence once again.

 DEN_increase_cooperation: "Increased Cooperation"
 DEN_increase_cooperation_desc: "Though we might not like to admit it, we would never have been able to hold back the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] invasion - and by capitulating we ensured a certain level of autonomy no other country under [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] enjoys. Therefore, we should endeavor to work more closely with our overlords to secure this independence and reap the benefits of this relationship."

Only by joining the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetFactionName] and pledging to contribute to the war effort will we ever be allowed to improve our army, navy, and air force.

 DEN_secure_the_norwegian_coast: "Secure the Norwegian Coast"
 DEN_secure_the_norwegian_coast_desc: "Denmark and Norway were unified for centuries, and if we want to control the North Sea, or expand beyond that, we must once again unify our countries. The Norwegian coast is a vital stepping stone if we want to dominate the Atlantic."
 DEN_reclaim_atlantic_islands: "Reclaim Our Atlantic Possessions"
 DEN_reclaim_atlantic_islands_desc: "The Faroes and Iceland might not have any natural resources to speak of, but it is nevertheless part of our realm and of vital strategic importance since the islands act as a stepping stone to dominate the North Atlantic.\n\nGreenland is the only part of our nation that actually has any kind of natural resources required to run a modern and effective military, making it our utmost priority."
 DEN_claim_sweden: "Claim Sweden"
 DEN_claim_sweden_desc: "The Swedes were once our fiercest rivals and were under our dominance on and off for centuries. And contrary to Denmark, Sweden has an abundance of natural resources that are required to run a modern military.

 DEN_safeguard_the_eastern_front_desc: "Finland has always been just out of our reach historically speaking, but with our resurgent power, we are more than capable to lay it under our hegemony. Securing Finland means securing our Eastern Front and strengthening our control over the Baltic Sea."

 DEN_sign_forsvarsforliget_desc: "With tensions rising in Europe once again, we must confess that our current defense capabilities are severely lacking.

 DEN_stockpile_oil: "Stockpile Oil"
 DEN_stockpile_oil_desc: "We must be ready for the worst and start preparing for war. Even if we never see combat, a major conflict in our vicinity will affect us. To minimize this impact we need to amass large reserves of strategic resources."

 DEN_expand_vaernepligten: "Expand Værnepligten"
 DEN_expand_vaernepligten_desc: "The military is barely even a token force, completely incapable of deterring any would-be invaders. If they are to put up an actual defense of the nation, we need to rapidly expand our conscription."
 DEN_haeren_reorganization: "Hæren Reorganization"

 DEN_expand_haerens_tekniske_korps_desc: "The Army's Technical Corps operates the Weapons Arsenal and Hærens Geværfabrik, which produces both weapons and ammunition.

 DEN_hjemmevaernet: "Hjemmeværnet"

 DEN_expand_dansk_industri_syndikat_desc: "Dansk Industri Syndikat, or Riffelsyndikatet as it is commonly known, is the country's largest weapons manufacturer and produces our army's Madsen rifles. Investing in and expanding their factories is of utmost national security interest."
 DEN_new_artillery_tactics: "New Artillery Tactics"
 DEN_new_artillery_tactics_desc: "Hærens Tekniske Korps produces guns and artillery and ammunition today. But by setting up an experimental division within Hærens Tekniske Korps we could perhaps design and produce our own artillery, something the army would benefit greatly from."
 DEN_convert_automobile_production: "Convert Automobile Production"
 DEN_convert_automobile_production_desc: "The time has come to order Danish automobile manufacturers to convert their civilian production lines to contribute to the war effort and support our defense capabilities. Securing our own production of trucks and mechanizing our army to a higher degree would make it more agile and flexible."

 DEN_slaedepatruljen_sirius_desc: "Mainland Denmark gets very little snow in the winter, and it rarely stays for long. However, we do possess Greenland, where the snow is kilometers thick all year round. We can take advantage of this and train our troops there to acclimatize them to the cold."

 DEN_establish_domestic_tank_manufacturing_desc: "Warfare has changed significantly in the 20th century - and we must change with it. A fast-moving, hard-punching army is the key to victorious battles nowadays. Securing our own supply of tanks will ensure success on the modern battlefield."
 DEN_expand_ubadsvabnet: "Expand Ubådsvåbnet"
 DEN_expand_ubadsvabnet_desc: "The best protection of our coastline and many islands, is the one the enemy can not see. Having a large submarine fleet will allow us to strike without being noticed and withdraw our forces without taking losses."

 DEN_modernize_the_navy: "Modernize the Navy"

 DEN_appropriate_odense_staalskibsvaerft: "Appropriate Odense Staalskibsværft"
 DEN_appropriate_odense_staalskibsvaerft_desc: "To truly expand the size of our navy, we need additional production capabilities. Seizing A.P. Møller-Mærsk's shipyards in Odense would accelerate our means of production significantly."
 DEN_restructuring_sovaernet: "Restructuring Søværnet"

 DEN_baltic_sea_domination: "Baltic Sea Domination"
 DEN_baltic_sea_domination_desc: "Before the rise of the Russian empire, and even before the short-lived Swedish empire, Denmark looked to dominate the Baltic Sea.

 DEN_north_sea_ambitions: "North Sea Ambitions"
 DEN_north_sea_ambitions_desc: "Ours is a wide-reaching nation, from the shores of Europe to the seas of the North Atlantic.

 DEN_domestic_designs: "Domestic Designs"
 DEN_domestic_designs_desc: "Our air forces are severely lacking in capability. This mostly stems from the fact that we don't produce our own aircraft, and therefore don't have the numbers to put up a fight if worse comes to worst. We need to establish a domestic production line for our very own airplanes."
 DEN_foreign_designs: "Foreign Designs"
 DEN_foreign_designs_desc: "Neither of our two air forces has the capability to design and build a functioning fighter or bomber. We should look elsewhere to purchase aircraft. If we find the design satisfying we can look into acquiring a production license. "

 DEN_unify_flyvevabnet_desc: "As it stands right now, we have two different and wholly separate air forces; the army's Hærens Flyvertropper, and the navy's Marinens Flyvevæsen. Both branches are often at odds with each other. Unifying them into one, single airforce unit would create a cohesive strategy and establish a new branch of the armed forces."
 DEN_flyvertaktisk_kommando: "Flyvertaktisk Kommando"
 DEN_flyvertaktisk_kommando_desc: "Having unified the two different branches of the airforce into one unit is not enough. For this new military branch to be as efficient and cohesive as possible, we need to create a central command structure that can coordinate the airforce properly."
 DEN_air_force_power_projection: "Air Force Power Projection"
 DEN_air_force_power_projection_desc: "Now that we have unified Flyvevåbnet into the third major branch of our military, we can focus on securing the skies of our widespread realm. A large and successful air force is still dependent on air bases where it can land and take off from."
 DEN_flyveskolen: "Flyveskolen"
