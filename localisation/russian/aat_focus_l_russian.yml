DEN_rally_the_nation_desc: "Now that we have seized control of the country, it is of utmost importance that we garner the support of the people. Whilst they might not be able to do much to opose us, it is much better to have a populace at your side and ready to fight for their nation than to have one with a knife in your back. Let us restore [DEN.GetAdjective] pride and rally the people to fight for their country!"

DEN_dano_german_military_cooperation_desc: "In order for us to advance our military to the point of being able to achieve our goals, it may be important for us to approach our fellow government in [GER.GetNameDef] and request military and technological cooperation.

DEN_assault_troops_desc: "Whilst the army can hold the line and push our foes back little by little, it is through the power of our elite troops in which we will find the power needed to destroy any threat that we face. We should prioritize their training and ensure that we have obedient, disciplined special forces waiting in reserve."
DEN_prioritize_navy: "Prioritize Søværnet"
DEN_prioritize_navy_desc: "The home territories are but a small peninsula, and as such it is of great importance that we prioritize the development of our fleet in waiting.

 DEN_seek_independence: "Seek Independence"

 DEN_create_danforce_desc: "[?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDefCap] has forbidden us from having a military large enough to truly threaten their supremacy.

 DEN_strengthen_the_danish_brigades_desc: "We will not be able to amass the same firepower that [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef] has, so we must fight smart and outwit them instead. We must study our enemies and find their weaknesses in order to exploit them on the battlefield."

 DEN_buy_foreign_ships: "Procure Destroyers"
 DEN_buy_foreign_ships_desc: "To secure [DEN.GetNameDef]'s coastline and many islands we must first secure a capable fleet that can protect our sea lanes.

 DEN_ask_for_weapons_desc: "Our [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] overlords keep depleting our weapon and munition stockpiles, crippling our ability to fight back when the day comes to declare our independence once again.

 DEN_increase_cooperation: "Increased Cooperation"
 DEN_increase_cooperation_desc: "Though we might not like to admit it, we would never have been able to hold back the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] invasion - and by capitulating we ensured a certain level of autonomy no other country under [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] enjoys.

 DEN_safeguard_the_eastern_front_desc: "Finland has always been just out of our reach historically speaking, but with our resurgent power, we are more than capable to lay it under our hegemony. Securing Finland means securing our Eastern Front and strengthening our control over the Baltic Sea."

 DEN_sign_forsvarsforliget_desc: "With tensions rising in Europe once again, we must confess that our current defense capabilities are severely lacking.

 DEN_stockpile_oil: "Stockpile Oil"

 DEN_haeren_reorganization: "Hæren Reorganization"

 DEN_expand_haerens_tekniske_korps_desc: "The Army's Technical Corps operates the Weapons Arsenal and Hærens Geværfabrik, which produces both weapons and ammunition.

 DEN_expand_dansk_industri_syndikat_desc: "Dansk Industri Syndikat, or Riffelsyndikatet as it is commonly known, is the country's largest weapons manufacturer and produces our army's Madsen rifles. Investing in and expanding their factories is of utmost national security interest."

 DEN_convert_automobile_production: "Convert Automobile Production"
 DEN_convert_automobile_production_desc: "The time has come to order Danish automobile manufacturers to convert their civilian production lines to contribute to the war effort and support our defense capabilities.

 DEN_baltic_sea_domination_desc: "Before the rise of the Russian empire, and even before the short-lived Swedish empire, Denmark looked to dominate the Baltic Sea.

 DEN_domestic_designs: "Domestic Designs"
 DEN_domestic_designs_desc: "Our air forces are severely lacking in capability.

 DEN_air_force_power_projection_desc: "Now that we have unified Flyvevåbnet into the third major branch of our military, we can focus on securing the skies of our widespread realm. A large and successful air force is still dependent on air bases where it can land and take off from."
