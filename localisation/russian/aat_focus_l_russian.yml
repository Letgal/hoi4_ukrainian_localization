 NOR_abandoning_nynorsk_desc: "Despite it's seemingly nationalistic purpose, Nynorsk is just an amalgamated language composed of many leftovers from rural backwaters and city dialects.

 NOR_norges_tekniske_hogskole_desc: "For over two decades, the Norwegian institute of Technology in Trondheim has been at the forefront of engineering in the country, but if we hope to compete with our neighbors and possibly our enemies, more funding into technical education will be necessary.

 ICE_the_armed_forces_of_iceland_desc: "If war comes to Iceland, Iceland must be able to defend itself. We must start building a force capable of defeating any would be invaders. It is a small island, with a small population, but the location and size can be a strength in itself as no enemy will be able to commit large forces to take it."
 ICE_an_airbase_in_the_sea: "An Airbase in the Sea"
 ICE_an_airbase_in_the_sea_desc: "By dominating the skies above the island, and the surrounding sea, we can ensure that no enemy can land here in strength. And even if they do, an air force can ensure that the enemy is always lacking necessary supplies. Thus, the natural way to build the Icelandic armed forces is to build a modern air force."
 ICE_a_naval_hub_in_the_atlantic: "A Naval Hub in the Atlantic"
 ICE_a_naval_hub_in_the_atlantic_desc: "Iceland is an island. Having the fleet as the main arm of the armed forces makes total sense. It can stop enemies from reaching our shores, it can support our allies in dominating the seas, and it can carry expeditionary forces wherever they need to go. Building a strong navy is the obvious choice for Iceland."
 ICE_mine_iceland: "Mine Iceland"
 ICE_mine_iceland_desc: "In terms of naval lanes, Iceland is exposed critically in all directions except for the north. To properly ensure the safety of the people on our island, we must be prepared to extensively mine Icelandic waters in case of open conflict."

 ICE_low_cost_aircrafts_desc: "What we don't have is a large industry, but what we do have are a select few individuals who know how to optimize plane construction. We should utilize their talents so that even with our admittedly weak economy, we can keep up in the aerial arms race."
 ICE_support_equipment: "Support Equipment"

 ICE_emergency_conversions: "Emergency Conversions"
 ICE_emergency_conversions_desc: "Though the nation doesn't necessarily have the capacity for heavy ships, we do have plenty of larger fishing vessels, trading vessels and private enterprise ships.

 ICE_doctrinal_studies: "Doctrinal Studies"
 ICE_doctrinal_studies_desc: "The art of war is not an easy one, let alone one that every nation can master. We need to study the global powers, and learn from how they wage their wars."
 ICE_death_from_above: "Death From Above"
 ICE_death_from_above_desc: "If we win the war in the air, we win the war, and we win it fast. Faster even, if we increase cooperation between our air and army branches, and train special para-shooting regiments ready to take out enemy supply-lines wherever possible."
 ICE_we_shall_defend_our_island: "We Shall Defend Our Island"
 ICE_we_shall_defend_our_island_desc: "Our island is our home, and no-one knows it as well as we do. By specializing our army in combat in the mountains, we could withdraw from the coast and destroy our nemies as soon as they have landed and started to feel confident and complacent."

 ICE_taking_the_fight_to_our_enemies_desc: "The sea surrounds us, and for centuries now, the great seas have shaped our people and who we are. By taking advantage of the knowledge we have gained from this, we can take the fight to our enemies, in locations they least except."
