italy.1.t: "Албанія поступилася"
italy.1.d: "Албанський уряд визнав наші претензії, а [ALB.GetLeader] був вимушений зректися влади. Відтепер і назавжди Албанія буде італійською!"
italy.1.a: "Славетний день."

italy.2.t: "Зоґу I відхиляє ультиматум"
italy.2.d: "Зухвалий до останнього король Зоґу I відхилив наш ультиматум. Він і його радники намагаються зібрати нікчемну оборону, яку можуть. Потрібно окупувати Тірану та покласти кінець цьому фарсу!"
italy.2.a: "Ми могли б піти легшим шляхом, Зоґу!"

italy.3.t: "Ультиматум від Італії"
italy.3.d: "Італійські дипломати висунули нам ультиматум з вимогою скоритися перед їхньою владою! Албанією керуватиме італійський король, як у особистій унії!"
italy.3.a: "Доведеться підкоритися."
italy.3.b: "Неприпустимо! Захистимо Зоґу!"

italy.4.t: "Розширення Альпійського валу"
italy.4.d: "Інженери Королівської італійської армії вивчили наш північний фронтир і визначили місця, де потрбіно розширити та зміцнити Альпійський вал. Необхідні накази про будівництво вже видані."
italy.4.a: "Якби ж ці укріплення були в часи Ганнібала..."

italy.5.t:0 "Італо-німецький технологічний договір"
italy.5.d:0 "Італія пропонує обмін технологіями та ідеями, які зблизять наші нації та зроблять нас обох сильнішими."
italy.5.a:0 "Чудова пропозиція!"
italy.5.b:0 "Німецькі технології тільки для німців!"
italy.6.t:0 "Італо-німецький технологічний договір — прийнято!"
italy.6.d:0 "Як ми і очікували, німці були в захваті від організації серії обмінів на технології. Зрозуміло, що в Європі віють нові вітри, і Італія на крок ближче до повернення колишньої слави!"
italy.6.a:0 "Чудово!"
italy.7.t:0 "Італо-німецький технологічний договір — відхилено!"
italy.7.d:0 "Німці відхилили нашу пропозицію щодо обміну технологіями."
italy.7.a:0 "Тепер нам краще сподіватися тільки на себе."
italy.8.t:0 "Приєднатися до французького альянсу"
italy.8.d:0 "Франистський рух набирає обертів у Франції і попросив нас приєднатися до їхнього альянсу. Чи відповідає це інтересам Італії?"
italy.8.a:0 "Приєднаймося до французів."
italy.8.b:0 "Ми не довіримося французам!"
italy.9.t:0 "Запросити Балеарські острови у Іспанії"
italy.9.d:0 "Під час громадянської війни Італія запропонувала добровольців боротися за націоналістичну справу. Хоча ідеологічні мотиви були першочерговими, Італія також мала стратегічну зацікавленість у результаті. Оборона Балеарських островів, особливо Майорки, представляла особливий інтерес для Італії через їхнє положення в Середземному морі, особливо по відношенню до західноєвропейських колоній.\n\nТепер [From.GetLeader] запропонував передати острови під італійський контроль назавжди. Враховуючи їхній внесок у нашу перемогу, пропозиції можуть бути й достоїнствами."
italy.9.a:0 "Нехай італійці зберігають те, що захищали."
italy.9.b:0 "Ми виграли цю війну не для того, щоб підкоритися іноземним вимогам!"
italy.10.t:0 "Іспанія віддає нам Балеарські острови"
italy.10.d:0 "Дякуючи за нашу підтримку та захист фашистської справи під час громадянської війни в Іспанії, [From.GetLeader] погодився зробити наші тимчасові військові об'єкти на Майорці, Менорці та Ібіці постійними. Хоча ці острови з їх важливим стратегічним положенням є бажаним доповненням до нашої імперії, здається, іспанці тепер вважають борг погашеним..."
italy.10.a:0 "Вони визнають нас законними власниками."
italy.11.t:0 "Іспанія не віддає нам Балеарські острови!"
italy.11.d:0 "Незважаючи на допомогу, яку ми надали їм у громадянській війні, [From.GetLeader] тепер відмовився надати нам Балеарські острови, захищаючи які воювали наші співвітчизники. Хоча вони наполягають на тому, що прагнуть підтримувати добрі відносини з нашою нацією, ми мусимо змусити їх віддати нам острови, тепер вже силою..."
italy.11.a:0 "Якщо виникне така потреба, ми все одно можемо вимогти їх."
italy.12.t:0 "Лондонська конференція"
italy.12.d:0 "Наші друзі в Югославії зазнали тиску з боку нашого північного сусіда. Корумповані та декадентські західні держави показали, чому вони згасають, не відстоюючи прав Югославії. Це може бути якраз відкриттям для молодшої, більш динамічної сили, яка має правильне лідерство, щоб цілеспрямовано вийти на світову арену! Наше головне командування повідомляє, що вони майже готові випустити наші непереможні легіони."
italy.12.a:0 "Це наш час!"
italy.12.b:0 "У нас буде краща можливість."
italy.13.t:0 "Перший Люблянський арбітаж"
italy.13.d_dalmatia_montenegro:0 "Оскільки югославська держава руйнується через свої власні суперечності, настав час для Італії віддати належне. Згасаючі сили на Заході можуть настільки боятися Італії, що відмовлять їй належне, але з'являються нові сили, які бачать справжню цінність Італії. Ми не тільки забезпечили те, що нам було відмовлено під час Понівеченої Перемоги, але й наш протекторат Албанії також побачив, що її територія зросла."
italy.13.d_montenegro:0 "Наше рішення приєднатися до зростаючої могутності Німеччини окупилося. Югославська держава прямує до розпаду, і німецьке керівництво має передбачливість побачити переваги італійської дружби. Чорногорія буде передана Албанії."
italy.13.d_dalmatia:0 "Після зради наших колишніх союзників на заході на Паризькій мирній конференції, де нам обіцяли Північну Далмацію, ми вирішили приєднатися до Берліна. Німеччина мудро вирішила, що італійська дружба надто цінна, щоб її ігнорувати, а наші претензії в Югославії слід визнати. Адріатика буде італійським озером, і справедливість буде відроджена."
italy.13.a:0 "Італія зростає"
italy.14.t:0 "Німеччина не підтримує наші вимоги!"
italy.14.d:0 "Німеччина вважала за потрібне перешкодити нашим скромним, справедливим і розумним вимогам щодо території Віші. Ми мусимо піти з альянсу [From.GetFactionName]?"
italy.14.a:0 "Це неприйнятно. Ми мусимо зробити це самостійно."
italy.14.b:0 "Ми заслужимо їхню повагу."
italy.15.t:0 "Німеччина підтримує наші претензії"
italy.15.d:0 "Німеччина побачила мудрість підтримати наші вимоги щодо території Віші. Віші віддав нам Савою та Корсику."
italy.15.d_Corsica:0 "За невеликої підтримки Німеччини Вішістьська Франція віддала нам Корсику"
italy.15.a:0 "Реванш за Італію"
italy.16.t:0 "Німеччина частково нас підтримує"
italy.16.d:0 "Німеччина вважала за потрібне втрутитися в нашу суперечку з Вішівською Францією. Вони заблокували нашу спробу завоювати Корсику, але в нас усе ще є Савоя."
italy.16.a:0 "Питання про Корсику відкладено"

#1st Missiolini localized at the beginning of the file along with Italo-Ethiopian War events
BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.t:0 "The Northern Front Stalls"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.desc:0 "The expected success of our counter-offensive in Northern Abyssinia is nowhere to be seen. The Duce swears that the entire world is laughing at him and the lack of progress in the war. He is of half a mind to personally take charge of the northern offensive to make sure the troops are properly motivated and led."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.a:0 "We will prevail - eventually"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.b:0 "We need a change of leadership!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.c:0 "A staggering failure!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.04_south.t:0 "The Southern Front Stalls"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.04_south.desc:0 "The Southern counter-offensive in Abyssinia has not reached the goals the Duce wanted, which has left him rambling for hours about being surrounded by incompetency and idiocy. He seems certain that the military high command is working against him and that the Generals want to see the entire war fail."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.04_south.a:0 "We will prevail - eventually"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.04_south.b:0 "We need a change of leadership!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.04_south.c:0 "A staggering failure!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.03_north.t:1 "Success in North Ethiopia"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.03_north.desc:0 "Mussolini has nothing but praise and admiration for the armies in northern Abyssinia and their success in pushing back their fierce opponents. He of course never doubted the prowess of our troops - as long as they got the right motivation from their Duce and the tools to prevail."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.03_north.a:0 "We have them on the run now!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.05_south.t:1 "Success in South Ethiopia"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.05_south.desc:0 "Overjoyed by the recent gains in Southern Abyssinia, Mussolini applauds the bravery of the Italian troops and their dedication to putting an end to this conflict. He never had any misgivings and fully trusted our armies to best the enemies on the battlefield - once they got the proper support from their Duce."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.05_south.a:0 "We have pushed back the enemy!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.11.t:0 "End the War"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.11.desc:0 "The Duce now wants a swift end to the war in Abyssinia, so that Italy can turn elsewhere for further glories. Conquering the ancient lands of Axum would solidify Italy's place as one of the major empires of the world. \n\nWhatever Abyssinian strongholds that are left need to be dealt with and all of the Abyssinian lands need to be in Italian hands."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.11.a:0 "The enemy will be defeated!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.12.t:0 "The War Continues"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.12.desc:0 "The fact that Abyssinia is still free and resisting occupation has had the Duce raging for hours on end, calling it an embarrassment; not only for him personally but for Italy and its people too. If only he could have overseen the last phases of the war himself it would have been done by now, he complains to everyone in his vicinity."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.12.a:0 "The Abyssinians are putting up a hard fight"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.13.t:1 "The Conquest of Ethiopia"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.13.desc:0 "Mussolini is ecstatic and brags far and wide to anyone willing to listen or otherwise about our recent victory. He never had any doubt that Italy would prevail and triumph in Abyssinia, despite the various setbacks we encountered. We have finally avenged the failure of the first Italo-Abyssinian war! \n\nThe Duce has hailed the conquest as a victory for the fascist system and his government, calling the Italian people stronger and more unified than ever before."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.13.a:0 "Blood alone moves the wheels of history"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.21.t:1 "Pacify Ethiopia"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.21.desc:0 "The Duce has publicly declared how the Abyssinians are crushed and on the run, their will broken after their defeat. Privately though, he curses the Abyssinians for their resilience and defiance toward Italian rule. The Duce has given the order to crack down on local opposition with brute force and to institute laws to keep the population in check. He wants the entire country pacified and brought into the Italian fold as soon as possible."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.21.a:0 "We will bring peace and stability"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.22.t:1 "Ethiopia still Resists"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.22.desc:0 "Abyssinia is still nowhere near being pacified, and the resistance to Italian occupation remains stiff. The Duce has no kind words for either the Abyssinian people or the efforts to quell the opposition and calls the operation a national embarrassment. He complains that the Italian colonists have a rough appearance and crude manners, which is not instilling any respect in the local population."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.22.a:0 "The Abyssinians are tougher than expected"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.23.t:1 "The Pacification of Ethiopia"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.23.desc:0 "We have finally managed to quell the resistance in Abyssinia, from the high mountain tops to the low desert plains its people are finding their place within the Italian fold. Delighted, Mussolini has declared that he can finally turn his attention to other matters so that Italy might prosper and claim what rightfully belongs to it."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.23.a:0 "Italy reigns supreme"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.31.t:0 "Industrialization Program"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.31.desc:0 "For Italy to truly flourish, the Duce has a plan to expand our production capabilities. To accomplish this vision of a prospering nation, we need more factories that can sustain the growth of our bustling empire."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.31.a:0 "Expand the Industries"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.32.t:0 "Lagging Industrialization Progress"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.32.desc:0 "The Duce has found the lack of progress to build up the nation's industrial capacity disturbing. He bemoans the constraints that are put upon him - by no fault of his own - which makes his vision of a prosperous Italy so much harder to realize."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.32.a:0 "We must try harder"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.33.t:0 "Successful Industrialization Program"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.33.desc:0 "The newly built factories have been hailed by Mussolini as the first step in the modernization of the Italian industries. The Duce is very pleased with how this raises the production capacity of the country and how it will allow him to further his visions for a greater Italy."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.33.a:0 "The first step towards greatness"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.41.t:0 "Strengthen the Military"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.41.desc:0 "Like the Roman Empire of old, our burgeoning empire is stretching far and wide and needs a strong army to protect it from the hordes of barbarians just beyond the borders. The Duce is confident that for Italy to contend with the other major powers we need to be able to put strength behind our words - or no one will take us seriously!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.41.a:0 "For Italy!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.42.t:0 "Failed Military Expansion"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.42.desc:0 "The lack of Italian soldiers is a returning concern of the Duce who sees our long borders with our rivals as a point of vulnerability. The Duce feels thwarted after our recently failed attempt to bolster the number of troops and has started to question the devotion of the people to his cause of restoring Italian greatness."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.42.a:0 "Italy will be protected - somehow"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.43.t:0 "The Expanded Italian Military"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.43.desc:0 "Mussolini has personally inspected some of the newly fielded troops that will protect our borders - and expand them if their Duce deems it necessary. He is very pleased with the increased numbers of divisions and boasts about how it is by his foresight alone that Italy now has a respectable army that even our enemies can not deny the strength of."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.43.a:0 "Italy stands secured"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.51.t:0 "Expand the Supply Trucks Fleet"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.51.desc:0 "Our recent conflicts have laid bare certain shortcomings in our logistical support for the army. The Duce has been convinced by the Italian high command to order a new supply fleet of trucks. Originally he wanted 5000 brand new Italian trucks assembled, but he's been talked down to accepting fewer - after being reassured that it will suffice."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.51.a:0 "At least it's not 5000 trucks"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.52.t:0 "Too Few Support Trucks"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.52.desc:0 "The failed delivery of new trucks for the army has had the Duce criticizing the industrial forces put behind the effort, complaining about the lack of vision. He is convinced that no one but him can truly see the great potential for Italy and its people."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.52.a:0 "Our armies will have to do without"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.53.t:0 "The Support Trucks Fleet Reinforced"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.53.desc:0 "Mussolini personally congratulated the factories involved in producing the new trucks for the army - calling the workers the backbone of Italy. He is now anticipating a more mobile military force that can move fast over large swathes of terrain without having to be constrained by lagging logistics."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.53.a:0 "Surely this will make our armies invincible"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.61.t:0 "Fuel Reserves Program"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.61.desc:0 "A modern army marches not only on its stomach but also on its fuel, and if there is none the entire war machine grinds to a halt. The Italian high command has finally persuaded the Duce that a modern military will be stopped dead in its tracks by the lack of fuel. All branches of the military need it, and we must be able to provide gas in large quantities if we are to be successful on the battlefields."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.61.a:0 "We must stockpile fuel"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.62.t:0 "Inadequate Fuel Reserves"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.62.desc:0 "The lack of fuel reserves is a constant worry for the military high command, who fear that airplanes will be grounded, the battleships anchored, and the armies standing still. The Duce is sure that Italy will persevere - as always - but is fuming that his explicit orders haven't been fulfilled yet."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.62.a:0 "We will have to manage"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.63.t:0 "Successful Fuel Reserves Expansion"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.63.desc:0 "Mussolini is fully confident that the Italian military is ready to wage a full-scale war now and not run out of fuel immediately. The military high command might not be quite as reassured but are nevertheless alleviated by the reserve that has been gathered so far."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.63.a:0 "Our reserves will surely come in handy"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.71.t:0 "Expand the Airforce"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.71.desc:1 "Ever since the Duce first formed the Aeronautica, it has become a symbol of national pride and one of the greatest airforces in the world. The only problem is that it's too small, and the Duce has now been convinced to produce additional aircraft to reinforce the Aeronautica."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.71.a:0 "The Aeronautica is our pride"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.72.t:0 "A Meager Airforce"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.72.desc:0 "The production of new aircraft had been planned to be a great propaganda piece by the Duce, who now has to scale back his original intentions. The lack of large amounts of new airplanes has the Duce livid and is looking for someone to blame for this fiasco."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.72.a:0 "Unfortunate"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.73.t:0 "The Airforce Successfully Strengthened"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.73.desc:0 "Mussolini has taken a personal interest in strengthening the airforce and used the production of new aircraft as an opportunity to showcase Italian industrialism. With the Aeronautica at its center, several pieces of propaganda have been made celebrating Italian aviation and engineering."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.73.a:0 "The Aeronautica will triumph!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.81.t:0 "Technological Innovations"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.81.desc:0 "The Duce has decided to showcase the superiority of the fascist system, and how it can focus resources and effort more effectively. He aims to show the Italians - and the rest of the world - at what great speed fascism can accomplish great leaps in technology. He also hopes that this will rally and unify the historically divided Italian people under fascism."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.81.a:0 "The entire world will see"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.82.t:0 "Unsatisfying Technological Progress"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.82.desc:0 "Trying to demonstrate the strengths of the fascist system has backfired on the Duce, who has been cursing anyone getting within earshot. Instead of rallying people around fascism, people are more skeptical and whispering among themselves about what a fool Mussolini is. Or so the Duce believes at least."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.82.a:0 "Merely a small setback"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.83.t:0 "Great Technological Innovations"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.83.desc:0 "The advertised technological leap the fascist system could make has paid off, and Mussolini has not hesitated to exhibit the innovations produced under his leadership. The message is as much about fascism as it is about Mussolini and his vision for Italy. Whether this will rally and unify the Italians in the way the Duce had hoped for remains to be seen."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.83.a:0 "For Duce and country!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.91.t:0 "Intelligence Service Expansion"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.91.desc:0 "The Duce has been swayed to boost additional resources toward our Intelligence Service, with promises of it becoming one of the world's finest. This in turn has led him to publicly brag about how our agents have infiltrated every aspect of Italian society to drag communists, criminals, and other harmful elements into the light and brought to justice, making Italy more secure."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.91.a:0 "Expand the Intelligence Service"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.92.t:0 "An Intelligence Service Fiasco"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.92.desc:0 "Instead of strengthening the Intelligence Service, several classified documents have been leaked - leaving a damning impression of our agents. Even though the documents did not contain secrets of any great significance, it is an embarrassment to the Duce who not long ago boasted about our intelligence apparatus. This will not only anger the Duce but also cause doubt in the minds of the Italian people and our enemies about our capabilities."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.92.a:0 "Truly an embarrassment"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.93.t:0 "A Great Intelligence Service Effort"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.93.desc:0 "The competence of our intelligence service has been proven beyond doubt after several dissenting citizens were captured for plotting to damage the fascist government of Italy with foreign aid. Mussolini has used this success to illustrate how it is by his guidance that Italy will prevail and overcome any hardships the future might bring."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.93.a:0 "Truly an achievement"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.101.t:0 "Occupy Albania"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.101.desc:0 "The strong ties between Italy and Albania go back millennia, to the Roman Empire. There is a strong historical connection between our two nations, a connection the Duce is determined to see deepened. He wants to incorporate Albania into Italy and has demanded a swift occupation of the country so that we fully control the inlet to the Adriatic Sea. This will bring glory and prestige to Italy, which for too long has been viewed as a lesser power by many other nations - or so he contends."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.101.a:0 "Glory to Italy!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.102.t:0 "Failure in Albania"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.102.desc:0 "The fact that our soldiers struggle to make any headway in Albania has perplexed the Duce who calls it a national embarrassment. In private he furiously mumbles about how this was supposed to be a glorious moment for Italy - and himself - and how it would vindicate our humiliating withdrawal from there almost 20 years ago. Instead, he says, we have been betrayed by incompetence and cowardice."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.102.a:0 "Disgraceful"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.103.t:0 "The Occupation of Albania"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.103.desc:0 "Mussolini delightfully declared that our troops were victorious in Albania, to an enthusiastic crowd. He continued with how the entire country now is in our grip and how this will lead Italy to further greatness and glory. The days of the old empires are numbered and the days of Italy are yet to come, he proclaimed."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.103.a:0 "For glories yet to come!"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.111.t:0 "Conquer Dalmatia"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.111.desc:0 "Even though we were among the victors in the Great War and had been promised Dalmatia through the London Pact, we were betrayed by our so-called allies. We never received what was promised to us, so now we have to take it by force, the Duce asserts. He further stated that it lies in Italy's destiny to take what rightfully belongs to us - no matter what the old powers say."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.111.a:0 "Dalmatia is rightfully ours"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.112.t:0 "The Stalled Invasion of Dalmatia"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.112.desc:0 "What was supposed to be a rapid invasion of the Adriatic coast has turned into a slog. Our troops have been bogged down in Dalmatia and have not been able to deliver the grand conquest that was promised to the Italian people. The Duce has been found on a few occasions in an almost catatonic state mumbling about how Dalmatia rightfully belongs to us. This has not been the show of force the Duce had hoped for."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.112.a:0 "This only deepens the injustice toward us"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.113.t:0 "The Conquest of Dalmatia"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.113.desc:0 "A grave injustice has finally been rectified! The Dalmatian coast is ours. Mussolini is euphoric, calling this victory a great moment for Italy and its people. He declared that a great grievance has long last been amended. People have taken to the streets to celebrate this momentous occasion."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.113.a:0 "An injustice undone"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.121.t:0 "Subdue Greece"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.121.desc:0 "In a recent speech, the Duce outlined his vision for a greater Italy, where one of the points he made was how we must break the confinements put upon us by the other major powers. He declared Greece a vital point for Italy and its expansion, an obstacle to overcome so that we might expand beyond the bonds beset upon us."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.121.a:0 "“Break the bonds"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.122.t:0 "Embarrassment in Greece"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.122.desc:0 "Greece's mountainous terrain has shown to be an insurmountable obstacle for our troops. They find themselves impeded and pinned down. The Duce is still convinced that victory will be ours - must be ours - and refuses to acknowledge any kind of setback. He argues fervently that our superiority will triumph in the end."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.122.a:0 "The resistance has been fierce"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.123.t:0 "The Subjugation of Greece"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.123.desc:0 "Like the Roman legions before us, we have now vanquished the enemy's troops and conquered the whole of Greece. Mussolini held a rousing speech in the shadow of the Parthenon, declaring the Italians and the Greeks brotherly peoples with centuries of shared history, and how they were now free to set their own course through history."
BBA_italy_missiolinis.123.a:0 "“For past and future glories"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.131.t:0 "Liberate Ticino"
BBA_italy_missiolinis.131.desc:0 "Ever since Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, the mountains have been a highway for barbarians straight into Italy's heartlands. The Duce has long wanted to secure the northern mountain passes and wants to take the opportunity to incorporate the Italian speakers of Ticino into their Motherland - unifying the Italian people wherever they may be."
