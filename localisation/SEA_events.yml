 SEA_japan_popup_events.31.desc: "With the triumph of the revolution and power now in the hands of the Kōza-ha the time has come to elect a premier for the new people's republic. The two party front-runners during the war were Sanzō Nosaka and Kyūichi Tokuda, and with the revolution triumphant they have both shown that they are capable and willing to lead us toward communism. While ideologically not always aligned both show great potential, and who the choice lands on is therefore entirely up to fate. Will it be the international Nosaka or the more experienced but perhaps less widely popular Tokuda?"
 SEA_japan_popup_events.31.a: "Sanzō Nosaka has the popularity"
 SEA_japan_popup_events.31.b: "Kyūichi Tokuda has the experience"

 SEA_japan_popup_events.32.t: "A Leader for the Rōnō-ha"
 SEA_japan_popup_events.32.desc: "Following the end of the civil war and the triumph of the revolution the Labor-Farmer faction has gained the confidence of the party and the people. Not being as orthodox in their ideals they have managed to gain many followers and as a result also the seat of power. The main question still remains however, who will become the next premier of the republic? Three candidates have been presented but the final election still remains. Will it be Hitoshi Yamakawa, who as a central figure in the socialist movement has shown his experience? Will it be Kanson Arahata, who has managed to gather large amounts of support with the people and therefore already was elected chairman? Or will it be Yamakawa Kikue, who despite her lesser prominence within the party has shown that she's fit for the role as both a leader and reformer?"
 SEA_japan_popup_events.32.a: "Hitoshi Yamakawa has the experience"

There are many differing opinions on how they best should be handled, some promoting reform and lowering them to the status of the common worker while some argue that they should face harsher punishments for their crimes against the people both during the war and long before.

 SEA_japan_popup_events.34.desc: "Many of our political thinkers have been reasoning that the lumpenproletariat are the main body of our revolution, and that the Ainu people are also included inside this group. Furthermore, they believe that the Ainu people have lived in a primitive communist system and deem them worthy of being the 'leaders of the Communist revolution'. The question now however stands as, in what way should they be so? Should it be by the incorporation of their traditions into our socialist society, or should it be through granting autonomy to the Ainu people?"
 SEA_japan_popup_events.34.a: "We should make use of their fascinating traditions"
