 PHI_the_red_sun_over_manila: "The Red Sun Over Manila"
 PHI_the_red_sun_over_manila_desc: "Communist sentiment is rising throughout the Philippines, and for the first time the tentative opportunity to take actual power has appeared.

 PHI_militarize_the_constabulary_desc: "The Philippine Constabulary had been merged into the central Philippine Army with the National Defense Act, however, in hindsight this might have been a mistake as the police forces left to replace it have proven to be inadequate.

 PHI_philippine_army_orchestra: "Philippine Army Orchestra"
 PHI_philippine_army_orchestra_desc: "The Philippine Constabulary Band is one of the foremost military bands in the world, and was given the honor of playing at a US President's inauguration.

 PHI_expand_airbases_desc: "Even if our allies wanted to deploy an air force to our islands, or should we develop the capability to produce one for ourselves, we do not have the space to actually base them!

 PHI_mosquito_fleet_desc: "A single torpedo, or a single shell can target and sink a single ship. Therefore, we must not have just a single ship, but an entire swarm. They might be able to get one, ten, even a hundred but they won't be able to sink us all! Worse, all it will take is for potentially just one of our own shots to strike true, and with our swarm we can hardly miss either."
 PHI_devil_boats: "Devil Boats"
 PHI_devil_boats_desc: "Our patrol boats have earned renown for their speed and daring, and particularly for their ability to strike hard and vanish into the mist like phantoms of the sea.
