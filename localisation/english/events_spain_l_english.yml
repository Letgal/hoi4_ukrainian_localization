spain.1.t: "Громадянська війна!"
spain.1.d: "Група вищих генералів Збройних сил зробили прооголошення, в якому засудили поточний уряд Іспанії! Вони влаштували правоцентристський переворот за підтримки консервативних монархістів і церкви. Значна частина військових сил стала на бік націоналістів, але поки вони не змогли захопити жодне велике місто, крім Севільї.\n\nЛіві добровольці тим часом збираються під знаменом республіканського уряду, готові підтримати його в боротьбі проти повстанців. Ці лоялісти може й погано треновані, та ніхто не може засумніватись у їхніх ентузіазмі й відданості.\n\nЛінії фронту розкреслені. Яку фракцію нам варто підтримати?"
spain.1.a: "Націоналістів!"
spain.1.b: "Республіканців!"

spain.10.d: "Після мирних виборів генерала Франсіско Франко як президента Іспанії була надія, що настане кінець жорстоким повстанням і політичним негараздам останніх років. Чутки, що Франко спробує встановити однопартійну диктатуру і себе як голову держави, були підживлені несподіваними зникненнями кількох лідерів опозиції.\nПісля швидкого суду офіцер карабінерів Хосе Ґаланфор був засуджений за зраду, і невдовзі сталася його публічна страта. Хоча це мало б стати ходом для придушення всякого спротиву підйому Націоналістичної Іспанії, ця подія призвела до зворотного ефекту. Ліві добровольці та навіть декотрі генерали об'єднались під знаменом Народної армії, готові боротися проти пригноблювачів-націоналістів. Хоча більшість із них погано треновані, їм вдалося захопити деякі ключові міста під час хаосу повстання.\n\nЛінії фронту розкреслені. Яку фракцію нам варто підтримати?"
spain.10.b: "Народну армію!"

spain.2.t: "Пошук міжнародної підтримки?"
spain.2.d: "Переворот не був повністю успішним, але карлісти, фалангісти й Конфедерація автономних правих змогли мобілізувати велику частину армії та скинути Республіку, що надто довго дозволяла нашій гордій християнській нації розпадатися в анархію. Результат усе ще невизначений, і світ із занепокоєнням спостерігає, яка сторона здобуде перемогу.\n\nМи не влаштували переворот, сидячи склавши руки, і цього не має робити світ, якщо він хоче розчавити червону загрозу. Інші нації в схожому процесі відновлення своєї національної слави мали б бути готові прийти нам на допомогу."
spain.2.a: "Надішлемо запит на оснащення й зброю."
spain.2.b: "Іспанія буде виграна ціною іспанської крові!"

spain.3.d: "Реакційні та фашистські війська в армії прагнули розбити Республіку одним швидким ударом, та вони не очікували ні спротиву, який вони зустріли у великих містах, ні стрімку мобілізацію робітничих військових організацій. Замість перевороту вони влаштували війну — війну проти прогресу та майбутнього, яке хоче іспанський народ.\n\nІ демократичні, і соціалістичні держави висловлюють підтримку Республіки, та небагато насмілюються допомогти напряму. Ми могли б попросити їх підтримати наші старання, інакше пригноблювачі відберуть і їхні свободу й солідарність."
spain.3.a: "Це міжнародна боротьба за стримання фашизму!"
spain.3.b: "Ми не станемо маріонеткою дегенерованих робітничих держав!"

spain.4.t: "Націоналістична Іспанія просить допомогу"
spain.4.d: "Громадянська війна в Іспанії стала мікрокосмом наших поглядів на глобальну ситуацію: комуністи та ліберали прагнуть знищити старі цінності, а ми беремося за зброю, щоби відновити їх. Не дивно, що націоналісти в Іспанії звернулися до нас і ще кількох країн по оснащення для майбутнього конфлікту." # Перевірити, чи точно стається під час ГВвІ

spain.5.t: "Республіканська Іспанія просить допомогу"
spain.5.d: "Спроба повалити Другу Іспанську республіку — це чіткий знак, що фашисти не дозволять квітам прогресу зацвісти навіть де вони природно вкорінюються. Республіканці та їхні союзники, суміш демократів, комуністів й анархістів, звернулися до нас та інших частин міжнародного суспільства по допомогу. Багато націй, що заявляють про захист демократії та свободи, втримали свою підтримку зі страху бути затягнутими у війну. Як нам відповісти?"
spain.5.a: "Пообіцяйте їм надіслати зброю й оснащення."
spain.5.b: "На жаль, ми не можемо дозволити собі втрутитися."

spain.6.t: "Націоналістична Іспанія вдячна за допомогу"
spain.6.d: "Той факт, що ми організували ленд-ліз для Націоналістичної Іспанії, не залишився непоміченим. У випадку їхньої перемоги ми зможемо знайти в них сильного союзника, коли Іспанія буде відбудована."
spain.6.a: "Будемо сподіватися, вони стримають червоний терор."

spain.7.t: "Республіканська Іспанія вдячна за допомогу"
spain.7.d: "Той факт, що ми організували ленд-ліз для Республіканської Іспанії, не залишився непоміченим. Якщо Республіка буде відновлена, ми зможемо сподіватися на їхню підтримку в наших зусиллях стерти фашизм з лиця землі."
spain.7.a: "Хай живе Республіка!"

spain.8.t: "Мадрид захоплений"
spain.8.d: "Війна завершилася перемогою. Мадрид знову наш і в нас є можливість знову зробити кількасотрічне місто центром Іспанії. Воно пережило багато битв і вимагає перебудови. Який є кращий варіант окрім як зробити його нашою столицею?"
spain.8.a: "Перемістити столицю в Мадрид."
spain.8.b: "Залишити поточну столицю."

spain.9.t: "Іспанські вибори 1936 року"
spain.9.d: "Друга республіка виявилася хиткою й нестабільною. [Root.GetLeader] може бути президентом за підтримки Народного фронту — широкої коаліції лівих рухів, яких підтримують республіканці, комуністи й анархісти.\n\nАле права опозиція, що включає консерваторів, монархістів і фашистів, також починає об'єднуватися навколо мети знищити Народний фронт. Яка б коаліція не розпалася, їхні опоненти ймовірно скористаються внутрішніми конфліктами, щоб улаштувати революцію. Ці вибори — не останнє випробування, яке Іспанії доведеться пережити для вирішення цього конфлікту."
spain.9.a: "Підтримати Народний фронт."
spain.9.b: "Об'єднати консервативні групи під знаменом Фаланги."

#lar_spain.1.desc:2 "Despite a massive election campaign by the Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Rights, it is the left-wing Popular Front formed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and Republican Left, with the aid of Anarchists, Communists, and Trade Unionists, which appears to have won the 1936 elections. Illustrating the heavily divided Spanish political landscape, the Popular Front's lead in the popular vote seems to be far more narrow than the comfortable lead in seats would indicate.\n\nWhichever new government will be formed under the leadership of President [Root.GetLeader] in the days and weeks ahead, it will have to deal with an increasingly alienated and hostile political Right. Rather than solve the political violence and societal unrest that grips our country, it therefore seems likely that the recent election's results will only serve to exacerbate it."

Major parts of the Army, Navy, and Air Force have ceased responding to government orders, while concurrently Carlist militias have revolted in the North of the country.\n\nComplete success of this attempted coup has only been prevented by unofficial people's militias who, through quick action, have managed to retain control of many of the targeted locations and cities. Despite this failure to meet their initial goals, however, it seems unlikely that the the insurrection's leaders will give up their strong position as willingly as they did in 1932. With neither side appearing inclined to compromise, the path lies wide open for the current situation to escalate into a nation-wide civil war..."
