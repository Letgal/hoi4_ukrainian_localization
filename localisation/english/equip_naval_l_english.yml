They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
ENG_submarine_3: "Клас «U»"
#ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean.

They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."

These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."

As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
ENG_battleship_3: "Клас «Lion»"
#ENG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
ENG_battleship_4: "Клас «Vanguard»"
#ENG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
ENG_SH_battleship_1: "Клас «Centurion»"
#ENG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
ENG_SH_battleship_2: "Клас «Lion II»"
#ENG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
ENG_carrier_1: "Клас «Courageous»"
#ENG_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
ENG_carrier_2: "Клас «Ark Royal»"
#ENG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
ENG_carrier_3: "Клас «Illustrious»"
#ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
ENG_carrier_4: "Клас «Implacable»"
#ENG_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

#FRA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized, displacing around 600tons. Though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of 4 ships each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
#FRA_submarine_1b: "Серія «630»"
#FRA_submarine_1c: "Клас «Redoutable»"
FRA_submarine_2: "Клас «Minerve»"
#FRA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
#FRA_submarine_2b: "Клас «Aurore»"
FRA_submarine_3: "Клас «Roland Morillot»"
#FRA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
FRA_submarine_4: "Клас «Phénix»"
#FRA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
FRA_destroyer_1: "Клас «Bourrasque»"
#FRA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament is smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
#FRA_destroyer_1b: "Клас «Chacal»"
#FRA_destroyer_1c: "Клас «Aigle & Vauquelin»"
FRA_destroyer_2: "Клас «Le Fantasque»"
#FRA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
#FRA_destroyer_2b: "Клас «Le Hardi»"
#FRA_destroyer_2c: "Клас «Mogador»"
FRA_destroyer_3: "Клас «L'Intrépide»"
#FRA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers ware a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, and had an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons had larger engines."
FRA_destroyer_4: "Клас «Hoche»"
#FRA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
FRA_light_cruiser_1: "Клас «Duguay-Trouin»"
#FRA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
FRA_light_cruiser_2: "Клас «La Galissonnière»"
#FRA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
FRA_light_cruiser_3: "Клас «De Grasse»"
#FRA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
FRA_light_cruiser_4: "Клас «Colbert»"
#FRA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
FRA_heavy_cruiser_1: "Клас «Suffren»"
#FRA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
FRA_heavy_cruiser_2: "Клас «Algérie»"
#FRA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
FRA_heavy_cruiser_3: "Клас «Saint Louis»"
#FRA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
FRA_heavy_cruiser_4: "Клас «Forbin»"
#FRA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
FRA_battle_cruiser_1: "Проєкт «Durand-Viel»"
#FRA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
FRA_battle_cruiser_2: "Клас «Dunkerque»"
#FRA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
FRA_battleship_1: "Клас «Courbet»"
#FRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
FRA_battleship_1b: "Клас «Bretagne»" 
FRA_battleship_2: "Клас «Richelieu»"
#FRA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
FRA_battleship_3: "Клас «Gascogne»"
#FRA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
FRA_battleship_4: "Клас «Alsace»"
#FRA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
FRA_SH_battleship_1: "Клас «Charlemagne»"
#FRA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
FRA_SH_battleship_2: "Клас «Napoléon Bonaparte»"
#FRA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provide the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
FRA_carrier_1: "Клас «Béarn»"
#FRA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
FRA_carrier_2: "Клас «Joffre»"
#FRA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
FRA_carrier_3: "Клас «Jean Bart»"
#FRA_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
FRA_carrier_4: "Клас «Clemenceau»"
#FRA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."

Спершу їх було спроєктовано з трьома одинарними гарматами на кормі та спареною гарматою в носовій частині, але згодом було оснащено однією гарматою в носовій частині. Пізніше чотири з восьми кораблів класу були переобладнані здвоєними баштами. Друга група з семи есмінців була побудована за дещо зміненим проєктом зі спареними гарматами в носовій частині."
 GER_destroyer_4: "Клас «Zerstörer 1944»"
 GER_destroyer_4_desc: "Хоча перший прототип дизельного есмінця («Zerstörer 1942») не був завершений, розробка цього типу кораблів тривала. Було зроблено кілька пропозицій, які врешті-решт призвели до проєкту «Zerstörer 1944». На додачу до важкого головного озброєння, кораблі мали збільшене у порівнянні з попередниками зенітне озброєння, в тому числі нову 5,5-см артилерійську установку ППО."

 GER_carrier_3: "Клас «Graf Zeppelin»"
 GER_carrier_3_desc: "«Graf Zeppelin» був єдиним класом кораблів Кріґсмаріне, спроєктований як авіаносець від самого кіля. Було замовлено два кораблі, але жоден із них не було завершено. За задумом, «Graf Zeppelin» мав нести 30 винищувачів Bf-109T і 12 пікіруючих бомбардувальників Ju-87E, корабельних версій Bf-109E і Ju-87D."
 GER_carrier_4: "Клас «Europa»"
 GER_carrier_4_desc: "У 1940-х роках Кріґсмаріне розглядав можливість переобладнання кількох цивільних кораблів на авіаносці. Найбільшим з цих кораблів був пасажирський лайнер Europa. Будучи найбільшим пасажирським кораблем у Німеччині, він використовувався як корабель-казарма та транспорт для перевезення військ до того, як почалися роботи з його переобладнання на авіаносець. Після завершення робіт він мав би водотоннажність 56 000 тонн і міг би перевозити авіагрупу з 42 літаків."

They were medium sized displacing around 600tons though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of four ships were each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."

Вони були побудовані наприкінці Першої світової війни та були оснащені новими, більшими 21-дюймовими торпедами. Вони служили до початку Другої світової війни, коли їх здебільшого використовували для середньої та навчальної роботи."
ENG_submarine_2_desc: "Човни класу T або Triton були розроблені для заміни великих підводних човнів класу O, P і R. Це були помірно великі підводні човни з великою дальністю, які добре підходили для Атлантичного та Тихого океанів. Ці човни були добре озброєними, стійкими платформами і широко використовувалися під час конфлікту, оскільки 25 відсотків побудованих човнів було втрачено під час війни."
ENG_submarine_3_desc: "Підводні човни класу U були малими підводними човнами, побудованими відповідно до програм надзвичайного стану війни 1940 і 1941 років. Спочатку розроблені як навчальні підводні човни, коли почалася війна, конструкція змінилася, що дозволило цим підводним човнам виявитися корисними в закритих водах Північного та Середземного морів. Через менші розміри їх радіус дії та озброєння були обмежені. Три підкласи склали клас: Undine, Umpire і Uproar."
ENG_submarine_4_desc: "Підводні човни класу V або класу Vampire базувалися на попередніх човнах меншого розміру U-класу. Вони були більші, але все ще відносно малі, з кращими морськими можливостями, але обмеженою дальністю дії та озброєнням."
ENG_destroyer_1_desc: "Серед цих есмінців були класи Admirality і Thornycroft V і W. Вони були побудовані в рамках Програми надзвичайної ситуації у війні. Вони були кінцевою еволюцією дизайну британських есмінців під час Першої світової війни, втілюючи вдосконалення своїх попередників, а також нові технологічні досягнення. Велика кількість цих кораблів була побудована на пізніх етапах Першої світової війни і згодом стала основою флотилій міноносців Королівського флоту. Починаючи з 1930-х років, їх було поміщено до резервних флотів, які згодом використовували для супроводу конвоїв. Це були добре озброєні швидкісні судна з хорошою дальністю."
ENG_destroyer_2_desc: "Есмінці класів G, H і I були замовлені в рамках Програм будівництва військово-морських сил 1933 і 1934 років. Загалом вони були повторами попереднього класу F із незначним зменшенням розміру. Озброєння в класах G і H таке ж, як і в класі F, в обох використовуються гармати калібру 4,7 дюйма. Ці кораблі мали велику дальність, були адекватно озброєні та мали потужний торпедний комплект. Вони активно використовувалися під час війни і зазнали численних втрат."
ENG_destroyer_3_desc: "Класи J, K і N були схожі на попередній клас Tribal, але замість того, щоб акцентувати увагу на гарматному озброєнні, конструктори повернулися до більш стандартної важкої торпеди та легшої установки гармати. Кораблі піддавалися модифікаціям протягом усього періоду військової служби. Модернізація включала поліпшені зенітні гармати та радар. Це були швидкісні, далекобійні та добре озброєні судна, ідеальні для супроводу флоту."
ENG_destroyer_4_desc: "Есмінці класу Battle, побудовані на основі еволюції британських есмінців, які використовувалися протягом війни. Кораблі були замовлені в рамках військово-морських програм 1942 і 1943 років. Вони були добре озброєні як гарматами, так і торпедами. Можливості, швидкість і радіус дії їхнього протиракетного озброєння зробили їх універсальними суднами. Їх пізнє введення у війну призвело до мінімального внеску."
ENG_light_cruiser_1_desc: "Легкі крейсери класу C були групою легких крейсерів, побудованих до та під час Першої світової війни для суворих умов Північного моря. Вони виявилися міцними та потужними суднами, незважаючи на те, що вони дещо маленькі та тісні. Їхнє озброєння було більш ніж задовільним, оскільки вони мали достатньо 6-дюймових гармат для боротьби з надводними цілями противника та важке торпедне навантаження для добивання ворожих суден і конвоїв. Вони широко використовувалися під час Першої світової війни та брали участь у багатьох наземних діях."
ENG_light_cruiser_2_desc: "Легкі крейсери типу «Southampton» були підкласом крейсерів класу «Town» і були розроблені для протистояння японським крейсерам типу «Mogami». Ці кораблі були добре броньовані, мали добру швидкість і дальність польоту, а також мали потужне озброєння з дванадцяти 6-дюймових гармат у чотирьох потрійних вежах. Вони були основою для багатьох наступних проєктів легких крейсерів РН воєнного часу."
ENG_light_cruiser_3_desc: "Легкі крейсери класу Crown Colony були вдосконаленими версіями раннього класу Town, але зі спрощеною конструкцією для прискорення будівництва та зниження витрат. Кораблі мали ті самі гармати, що й їхні попередники, чотири потрійні вежі з 6-дюймовими гарматами. Вони були так само броньовані, але через менші двигуни їх радіус дії дещо зменшений. Тип включав два підкласи: Fiji та Ceylon."
ENG_light_cruiser_4_desc: "Також відомі як клас Swiftsure, ці крейсери були розроблені як модифікована версія класу Crown Colony, що включає військові модифікації, які були дозволені в 1941 році. Вони мали більший радіус дії та більшу кількість зенітної зброї, ніж клас Crown Colony, тоді як основні озброєння скорочено до трьох потрійних башт. Побудовані надто пізно, щоб вплинути на результат війни, більшість замовлених суден були згодом скасовані."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc: "Крейсери типу Hawkins були першими важкими крейсерами у світі. Вони базувалися на попередніх легких крейсерах класу «Town», зокрема підкласу «Birmingham», але були оснащені 7,5-дюймовими гарматами та товстішим броньовим поясом. Вони були розроблені для боротьби з великими рейдерами конвоїв Німеччини. Вони були добре озброєні, мали прийнятну швидкість і дальність польоту, а також хороший захист. Всього було введено в експлуатацію п'ять кораблів, але на початку Другої світової війни діяли лише чотири."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc: "Важкі крейсери типу «Surrey» були запропоновані в рамках військово-морської програми 1928 року. Вони були вдосконаленими версіями попередніх важких крейсерів типу «York». Якби вони були завершені, вони були оснащені чотирма подвійними 8-дюймовими гарматними турелями, важчою бронею та потужнішими двигунами. Було замовлено два кораблі, але жоден не був закладений."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc: "Важкі крейсери класу «Admiral» (не плутати з лінійними крейсерами класу «Admiral») були останньою спробою Королівського флоту спроєктувати та побудувати крейсери, озброєні 8-дюймовими гарматами. Дослідження дизайну почалися в 1938 році і закінчилися в 1941 році, в результаті чого з'явилися різні пропозиції. Остаточні пропозиції включали нові 8-дюймові гармати в потрійних вежах, важке зенітне озброєння, товсту броню та хорошу швидкість. Брак ворожих крейсерів і економічна ефективність цих суден призвели до того, що натомість зосередилися на будівництві більш легких крейсерів."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc: "Ці кораблі були запропоновані сером Вінстоном Черчиллом, лордом Адміралтейства, на ранніх етапах Другої світової війни для протидії німецьким великим артилерійським крейсерам класу Deutschland. Ці кораблі мали 9,2-дюймові гармати, важку зенітну зброю та міцну броню. Вони були розроблені для ефективної боротьби з головними кораблями противника. Кораблі врешті-решт були скасовані через високу вартість і відсутність попиту на новий важкий крейсер."
ENG_battle_cruiser_1_desc: "Лінійні крейсери класу Renown спочатку були закладені як вдосконалені версії лінійних кораблів класу Revenge. З початком Першої світової війни їх будівництво призупинили. Адмірал Лорд Фішер зумів відновити їх будівництво як лінійних крейсерів. Ці кораблі були квінтесенцією лінійних крейсерів. Вони були добре озброєні, швидкі та маневрені, але мали тоншу броню та меншу дальність дії. Лише два з початкових трьох кораблів, Repulse і Renown, були завершені."
ENG_battle_cruiser_2_desc: "Princess Royal — це клас гіпотетичних лінійних крейсерів, які були швидшою та дешевшою версією лінійних кораблів класу King George V. Ці судна мали подібне, але зменшене озброєння як для надводного, так і для протиповітряного бою: дві потрійні 14-дюймові гармати та шість здвоєних 5,25-дюймових зенітних гармат. Їхня швидка швидкість і великий радіус дії забезпечили б Королівському флоту можливість швидкого удару та захисту конвою, але їх обмежена броня виявилася б проблематичною, якщо б їм довелося битися з сучасними лінкорами."
ENG_battleship_1_desc: "Лінкори типу «Revenge» були замовлені в 1913 році як дешеві версії швидкісних дредноутів типу «Queen Elizabeth». Незважаючи на схоже озброєння та броню, їхня значно нижча швидкість відсунула їх до другорядних завдань під час Другої світової війни. Із запланованих 8 кораблів цього класу було закінчено лише 5."
ENG_battleship_2_desc: "Лінкори класу King George V були результатом Вашинґтонського 1922 року та Першого Лондонського військово-морського договору 1930 року, які обмежували максимальну водотоннажність і стрільбу капітальних кораблів. Таким чином, ці кораблі були оснащені гарматами меншого калібру, ніж попередні та навіть сучасні броненосці. Незважаючи на менший калібр, кораблі були адекватно озброєні, мали потужне зенітне озброєння та належний захист. П'ять кораблів було замовлено та закладено на заміну старим лінкорам класу Queen Elizabeth."
ENG_battleship_3_desc: "Лінкори типу «Lion» були наступним класом лінкорів «King George V» і мали багато їхніх особливостей. У рамках Військово-морської програми 1938 року було замовлено шість кораблів для заміни застарілих лінійних кораблів класу «Revenge», але жоден не був закінчений через вибух бойових дій. Кораблі мали бути загалом подібними до кораблів класу «King George», але основне озброєння було б важчим, з новою 16-дюймовою гарматою. Вони також мали б товщу броню та потужніші двигуни."
ENG_battleship_4_desc: "Лінкор типу «Vanguard» був останнім лінкором, побудованим для Королівського флоту. Було замовлено один корабель, але розглядалося ще чотири для тихоокеанського театру. Будівництво, замовлене згідно з Програмою надзвичайної війни 1940 року, не набуло великого пріоритету і було завершено після війни. Цей клас мав гладкий корпус, що забезпечувало відмінну стійкість і морехідність. Озброєння таке ж, як у лінкорів класу «Queen Elizabeth» і «Revenge», забезпечуючи значну вогневу міць. Потужні двигуни і хороша броня зробили судно швидким і добре захищеним."
ENG_SH_battleship_1_desc: "Centurion — клас гіпотетичних важких лінійних кораблів Королівського флоту, побудованих для протидії великим суднам німецького та японського флотів. Великі 18-дюймові гармати та товста броня забезпечують кораблю необхідну вогневу міць і захист для боротьби з цими суднами. Потужне зенітне озброєння, велика дальність і хороша швидкість були необхідні для покриття величезних морів Британської імперії."
ENG_SH_battleship_2_desc: "Лінкори класу Lion II були розроблені в 1944 році як вдосконалена версія попереднього лінкора класу Lion. Враховуючи уроки воєнного часу, ця конструкція була більшою та важчою, і якщо її завершити, вона матиме три або чотири потрійні 16-дюймові гармати останнього типу. Товсті броньові плити захищали корабель від будь-якої поверхні або повітряного противника. Витрати на будівництво цих кораблів, поразка ворожих флотів і потреба в авіаносцях призвели до відмови від проєкту."
ENG_carrier_1_desc: "Ці три авіаносці були переобладнаними лінійними крейсерами і були першими авіаносцями Королівського флоту. Їхнє переобладнання стало результатом Вашинґтонського військово-морського договору 1922 року, і робота була завершена у 1925 році. Це були помірно броньовані, але добре озброєні судна, з великою дальністю та хорошою швидкістю, але через характер переобладнання їхня авіація доповнюється обмежений. Тим не менш, вони дали Королівському флоту важливий досвід у будівництві авіаносців і повітряному проєктуванні флоту."
ENG_carrier_2_desc: "Авіаносець Ark Royal став першим подібним судном, побудованим відповідно до обмежень Вашинґтонського морського договору. Це перше судно, на якому ангари і польотна палуба були невід'ємною частиною корпусу. Сконструйований у 1934 році, судно добре броньоване та озброєне. Він мав велику кількість літаків і мав достатню дальність і швидкість, щоби не відставати від основних сил Королівського флоту."
ENG_carrier_3_desc: "Клас Illustrious був розроблений в рамках обмежень Другого Лондонського військово-морського договору 1936 року, який обмежив розмір носія верхньою межею в 23 000 тонн. Він був першим британським авіаносцем, який мав броньовану пілотну палубу, що зменшило розмір його авіагрупи. Важка броня та зенітна зброя забезпечували міцний захист кораблів, а потужні двигуни та великий запас палива забезпечували кораблям велику дальність дії."
ENG_carrier_4_desc: "Авіаносці класу Implacable були замовлені відповідно до військово-морської програми 1938 року і були по суті вдосконаленими версіями раннього класу Illustrious. Війна та перехід пріоритету на менші судна для охорони конвою на ранніх і середніх етапах війни уповільнили скорочення цих суден. Це були більші судна, здатні перевозити більше літаків, зберігаючи товсту броню як на корпусі, так і на польотній палубі. Потужніші двигуни забезпечили йому більшу швидкість і радіус дії порівняно з класом Illustrious."

FRA_submarine_1_desc: "Серія 600-тонних підводних човнів була першими сучасними підводними човнами Франції після Першої світової війни. Вони були середнього розміру, водотоннажністю близько 600 тонн. Незважаючи на те, що вони були морськими, вони називалися прибережними підводними човнами і використовувалися переважно в теплих водах Середземного моря. Три класи по 4 кораблі кожен побудовані цього типу: класи Sirène, Ariane і Circé. Вони були основою більшої 630-тонної серії класів Argonaute, Diane та Orion."
FRA_submarine_2_desc: "Підводні човни класу «Minerve» (назва проєкту T2) базувалися на 630-тонній серії, хоча вони мали кращі двигуни та іншу компоновку торпед. Ці підводні човни були першою частиною програми стандартизації, яка стала результатом централізованого проєктування DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale), а не проєктів попередніх класів, призначених для верфі."
FRA_submarine_3_desc: "Підводні човни типу Roland Morillot (назва проєкту Z2) були великими океанськими підводними човнами, заснованими на попередніх підводних човнах класу Redoubtable. Це були великі підводні човни водотоннажністю 1800–2400 тонн і несли потужне озброєння з 10 торпедних апаратів. Падіння Франції відбулося до того, як усе було завершено."
FRA_submarine_4_desc: "Підводні човни класу Phénix були середнього розміру океанськими і далекобійними човнами, дозволеними у військово-морських програмах 1939-40 років, але початок війни та падіння Франції призвели до скасування цих човнів. Вони були схожі на клас Redoutable, хоча були меншими та водотоннажністю 1200 тонн. Вони мали таке ж важке торпедне озброєння."
FRA_destroyer_1_desc: "Есмінці типу «Bourrasque» були частиною 1500-тонної серії і спущені на воду в середині 1920-х років. Разом із попереднім класом Chacal і наступним L'Adroit вони становили основу нового сучасного післявоєнного французького флоту. Вони були швидкісні та добре озброєні для свого часу, але їх торпедне озброєння менше порівняно з аналогічними кораблями інших флотів."
FRA_destroyer_2_desc: "Есмінці типу Le Fantasque були по суті вдосконаленими версіями попередніх супересмінців 2400-тонної серії (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin), побудованих за військово-морською програмою 1930 року. Це були великі, важкоозброєні та дуже швидкі міноносці, ідеальні для супроводу нових швидкісних підрозділів французького флоту. Їхнє озброєння складалося з нещодавно розроблених гармат, адекватного зенітного та торпедного озброєння."
FRA_destroyer_3_desc: "Есмінці типу L'Intrépide являють собою модифіковану версію попередніх есмінців класу Le Hardi. Вони були дозволені у військово-морських програмах 1938 та 1939 років, але війна та падіння Франції призвели до скасування цих суден. Вони були б більше зосереджені на зенітній ролі, і мали б збільшення водотоннажності до 2800–2900 тонн, мали б більші двигуни."
FRA_destroyer_4_desc: "Класи Hoche і Bayard були останнім проєктом супересмінця французького флоту. Обидва класи базувалися на класі Mogador, водотоннажністю 4200 тонн із подібним основним озброєнням, але вдосконаленими зенітними гарматами та потужнішими двигунами. Вони були дозволені у військово-морських програмах 1939-40 років, але початок війни та падіння Франції призвели до скасування цих кораблів."
FRA_light_cruiser_1_desc: "Легкі крейсери Duguay-Trouin були першими великими французькими військовими кораблями, побудованими після Першої світової війни за військово-морською програмою 1922 року. Вони стали першими легкими крейсерами з закритими головними вежами зі суперстрільбою. Серед легких крейсерів вони мали сильне торпедне озброєння, але практично не мали броні."
FRA_light_cruiser_2_desc: "Легкі крейсери типу La Galissonnière були відповіддю на італійські легкі крейсери типу Condottieri і базувалися на попередньому класі Emile Bertin. Вони були побудовані в рамках військово-морських програм 1931 і 1932 років із типовим основним озброєнням і відповідним протиракетним озброєнням того часу. Вони мали водотоннажність 10850 тонн, мали збільшену кількість літаків-розвідників і мали хорошу швидкість."
FRA_light_cruiser_3_desc: "Крейсери типу «DeGrasse» були дозволені у військово-морських програмах 1938 і 1939 років і являли собою істотно вдосконалені La Galissonnières. Вони мали потужніше зенітне озброєння, а також більші двигуни. Падіння Франції призвело до того, що останні два кораблі були скасовані, а головний корабель був закінчений після війни як інший проєкт. Німці збиралися закінчити її як легкий носій, але і цей проєкт не був реалізований."
FRA_light_cruiser_4_desc: "«Colbert» був зенітним легким крейсером, спущеним на воду в 1956 році. Цей крейсер типу «Colbert» був побудований дуже схожим на післявоєнний «De Grasse», оснащений важким зенітним озброєнням як для дальньої, так і для малої дистанції. Різниця між Colbert і DeGrasse полягає в тому, що Colbert мав менші двигуни, тоншу броню і був трохи меншим."
FRA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc: "Важкі крейсери типу Suffren були в основному повторенням попереднього класу Duquesne з незначними поліпшеннями щодо його морехідних можливостей. Обидва класи нагадували сучасну філософію крейсерів французького флоту; дуже тонка броня, але хороша швидкість і дальність. Їх стандартна водотоннажність становить 10 000 тонн, вони були оснащені стандартним для важкого крейсера озброєнням."
FRA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc: "Важкий крейсер типу Algérie був подальшим удосконаленням попередніх класів Suffren і Duquesne, але розроблений, щоби стати противником нових італійських важких крейсерів класу Zara. Істотно посилено як основний броньовий пояс, так і підводний захист. Його зенітне озброєння відповідає своєму часу, але через ці зміни стандартна водотоннажність перевищує 10 000 тонн."
FRA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc: "Важкі крейсери типу Saint Louis базувалися на класі Algérie, але загальний вигляд був ближчим до головних кораблів класу Dunkerque і Richelieu. У військово-морській програмі 1940 року було замовлено три кораблі, але у зв'язку з падінням Франції жоден із них не був закладений. Вони поставили б нові гармати та поліпшили зенітне озброєння, але броня була б такою ж, як на класі Algérie. Це був останній важкий крейсер конструкції ВМС Франції."
FRA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc: "Важкі крейсери класу «Forbin» були гіпотетичним проєктом як продовження класу «Saint Louis». Призначений для захисту торговельних шляхів між материковою Францією та колоніями, він мав велику дальність і хорошу швидкість разом із важким озброєнням із чотирьох потрійних веж і достатньою кількістю зенітної зброї. Компонування корабля та загальний вигляд нагадували вплив попереднього класу Saint Louis, а також британського класу Crown Colony."
FRA_battle_cruiser_1_desc: "Проєкт лінійного крейсера Durand-Viel був пропозицією в серії досліджень часів Першої світової війни. По суті, це були лінійні крейсерські версії лінійних кораблів класів Normandie і Lyon, які мали ті ж чотирикутні вежі та гармати, хоча й у зменшеній кількості. Як і сучасні лінійні крейсери інших флотів, вони були б швидшими, але менш броньованими, ніж лінійний корабель. Вони були скасовані перед початком Першої світової війни."
FRA_battle_cruiser_2_desc: "Dunkerque були розроблені для протистояння німецьким кишеньковим лінкорам класу Deutschland. Вони були вершиною серії досліджень дизайну з середини 1920-х до початку 1930-х років. Схвалені у військово-морських програмах 1931 та 1934 років, вони були схожі на британські лінкори класу «Nelson», з усіма їхніми головними вежами, зосередженими вперед. Це призвело до коротшої поясної броні і, отже, до меншого корабля, який відповідав обмеженням військово-морських угод."
FRA_battleship_1_desc: "Лінкори типу Courbet були першими супер-дредноутами, побудованими для ВМС Франції до та під час Першої світової війни. Уповноважені у військово-морських програмах 1910 та 1911 років, вони мали обмежену службу під час Першої світової війни, але були активними під час Другої світової війни. Хоча вони мали товщу броню та міцніші гармати, ніж попередні лінкори класу «Данте», вони все одно поступалися сучасним лінкорам USN та RN. Вони водотоннажністю трохи більше 22 000 тонн, і їх єдиними модернізаціями до Другої світової війни були поліпшене зенітне озброєння та вдосконалені котли."
FRA_battleship_2_desc: "Лінкори типу «Richelieu» були останніми лінкорами, прийнятими до складу ВМС Франції. Вони були вдосконаленою конструкцією «Dunkerque» і дозволені відповідно до військово-морських програм 1935 і 1938 років. Вони мали відмінне зенітне озброєння, швидкість і дальність польоту, що робило його чудовим капітальним кораблем. З чотирьох замовлених лише два були запущені, а один був завершений до падіння Франції. Були численні спроби закінчити інші кораблі, використовуючи різні проєкти, запропоновані для використання як зенітні лінкори, гібриди лінкорів і авіаносців або повномасштабні авіаносці."
FRA_battleship_3_desc: "Лінкори класу Gascogne були підкласом класу Richelieu. У рамках військово-морської програми 1940 року було замовлено три кораблі, але жоден не був запущений. Конструкція була б повторенням конструкції Richelieu, але з рівномірним розподілом основного озброєння в носовій і кормовій частині, поліпшеним протиракетним озброєнням і вдосконаленими двигунами, що призвело б до кращого корабля."
FRA_battleship_4_desc: "Лінкори класу «Alsace» повинні були замінити кораблі «Richelieu». Було замовлено чотири кораблі, дослідження дизайну були завершені в 1939 році, дозволені в 1940 році, і, як очікується, будуть закладені в 1941 році, хоча падіння Франції завадило цьому статися. Він удосконалює конструкцію Richelieu з більш важкими та більшими основними гарматами, потужнішим зенітним озброєнням, товщими броньовими пластинами та більшими двигунами."
FRA_SH_battleship_1_desc: "Суперлінкори класу «Charlemagne» — це гіпотетична конструкція, яка відповідає великим лінійним кораблям інших флотів. Вони мають важке озброєння на передньому плані, важке зенітне озброєння та товсту броню. Весь дизайн запозичив елементи з класів Richelieu та британського Nelson."
FRA_SH_battleship_2_desc: "Лінкори типу «Napoléon Bonaparte» були гіпотетичним проєктом і базувалися на класах «Alsace» і «Gascogne». Його важке озброєння розподілено рівномірно в носовій і кормовій частинах у потрійних вежах, із надстрільними вторинними частинами та важким зенітним озброєнням. Товста броня та потужні двигуни забезпечують швидкість і захист, необхідні для того, щоби не відставати від інших кораблів флоту та ефективно боротися з противниками."
FRA_carrier_1_desc: "«Béarn» спочатку був закладений як лінкор типу «Нормандія», але пізніше був перероблений як авіаносець, водотоннажністю 22 100 тонн і служив у міжвоєнні роки та Другу світову війну. Як переобладнаний авіаносець, його швидкість була низькою, і він мав обмежений простір для літаків, але середній броньовий пояс і велика дальність компенсували ці недоліки. Його будівництво дало важливий досвід французьким дизайнерам у DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) і призвело до низки проєктних досліджень згодом."
FRA_carrier_2_desc: "Авіаносці класу Joffre (назва проєкту PA-16) були наступним поколінням авіаносців для ВМС Франції. Це було останнє з проєктних досліджень, які почалися в 1929 році і закінчилися в 1937 році. Два кораблі були дозволені у військово-морській програмі 1938 року, але ескалація конфліктів уповільнила процес будівництва, і врешті-решт падіння Франції завадило завершенню будівництва цих кораблів. Водотоннажність становитиме близько 20 000 тонн. Вони мали б хороше зенітне озброєння, броню та швидкість, але доповнювали літаки нижче середнього. Загалом, це був би всебічний і універсальний авіаносець для ВМС Франції."
FRA_carrier_3_desc: "Авіаносець «Jean Bart» був пропозицією середини війни перетворити недобудований лінкор «Jean Bart» класу Richelieu на повномасштабний авіаносець подібно до японського IJN Shinano. Великі розміри корпусу призведуть до створення великого авіаційного компонента, а разом із великими двигунами — дальнього та швидкого авіаносця. Важке зенітне озброєння американського виробництва забезпечить хороший захист від авіації та менших надводних бойових дій."
FRA_carrier_4_desc: "Авіаносець класу «Clemenceau» (назва проєкту PA-28) був першим післявоєнним авіаносцем французького флоту. Конструкція була б подібна до недобудованих авіаносців класу Joffre, хоча встановлене обладнання та озброєння були б сучасними французькими виробами. Придбання ескортних авіаносців USN і RN і економічний стан післявоєнної Франції запобігли закладці цих кораблів. Не плутати з останніми авіаносцями класу Clemenceau (проєктна назва PA-54), які були закладені в 1955 і 1957 роках."

SOV_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
SOV_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
SOV_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
SOV_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
SOV_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
SOV_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
SOV_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
SOV_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
SOV_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
SOV_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
SOV_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
SOV_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
SOV_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
SOV_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
SOV_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
SOV_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
SOV_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
SOV_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
SOV_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
SOV_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
SOV_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
SOV_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
SOV_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
SOV_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
SOV_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
SOV_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
SOV_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
SOV_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

USA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."
USA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Porpoise Class submarine was the US Navy's first modern submarine designed and built following a series of experimental "V Boats" built in the late 20s and early 30s. Despite initial issues with the all-electric propulsion, the class held promise and was being considered as future designs. The class was armed with 6 torpedo tubes and a 3" deck gun."
USA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Tambor class was the culmination of years of US Naval experimentation of both Submarine design to fit the role of "Fleet Boat" and perform well in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Armament was upgraded to 10 torpedo tubes with four firing aft, 3" deck gun with two AA guns for additional protection."
USA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Balao Class was a continuation of the design rooted in the Tambor class. Improvements came in the form of hull reinforcement and upgrading the deck gun to a 5"/24 caliber along with numerous subtle design improvements."
USA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4"/50 caliber main guns, a 3"/23 caliber AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was aging and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
USA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sims Class was the largest "1500 Tonner" design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 caliber guns and included 12 centerline torpedo tubes."
USA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5"/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
USA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5"/38 caliber guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve maneuvering during ASW operations."
USA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 caliber guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was aging but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
USA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximize firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
USA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. The Cleveland Class keeps the 12 6" main gun arrangement, but increased its secondary 5" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry."
USA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Fargo Class improved on the successful Cleveland Class. It offered improved fields of AA fire thanks to a better designed pyramid-shaped superstructure."
USA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8"/55 guns. The hull armor was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."
USA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 caliber guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5"/38 guns. "
USA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armor from the USS Wichita."
USA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers."
USA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
USA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor."
USA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
USA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
USA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations."
USA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs."
USA_carrier_3_desc:1 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large complement of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
USA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armored deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."

ARG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Santa Fe-class class represents three submarines ordered from Italy and delivered to Argentina in 1933. The three ships of the class formed the backbone of the Argentinian Submarine Force until 1960. They were nicknamed the 'Tarantinos' for the dockyards in Taranto, Italy where they were built."
ARG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Catamarca-class destroyers were ordered by the Argentine Navy and built by the U.K. shortly before World War I. They were armed with four 120mm/50 cal main guns and four 533mm torpedo tubes."
ARG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "Buenos Aires-class destroyers were built in the U.K. for Argentina between 1936 and 1938. They were based off the British G-class destroyers. They displaced over 1300 tons and were armed with four QF 4.7 in. Mark IX cannon as their main guns."
ARG_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Libertad-class ships were given the designation of 'River Battleship' but were actually more comparable to the smaller, more lightly armed protected cruisers of the early 1900s. Two ships of the class were built in the late 1890s and were still in commission at the start of World War II."
ARG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Argentina light cruiser was built for Argentina by the U.K. in the late 1930s. She made several training cruises before the war but was placed in the active squadron to maintain Argentine neutrality. The ship was an enlarged version of the British Arethusa class, displacing 6500 tons and armed with nine 6 in. cannon as its main guns."
ARG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Garibaldi class represents a class of armored cruisers built for Argentina around the turn of the century. All were obsolete by the mid-1930s, with the last one being decommissioned by 1932. They were replaced in 1931 by the British-built Veinticinco de Mayo-class heavy cruisers."
ARG_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Rivadavia-class was a pair of U.S.-built dreadnought battleships built for the Argentine navy in the early 1910s. They displaced 27,500 tons and were armed with twelve 305mm/50 call cannon as their main guns. They remained in service until the 1950s."

AST_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes, which were transferred to the RAN to form the 'Scrap Iron Flotilla'. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
AST_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Nizam class was the designation of the J, K, and N class destroyers transferred from the RN. They were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
AST_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels."
AST_light_cruiser_1_desc:2 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
AST_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
AST_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets."
AST_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
AST_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser."
AST_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
AST_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
AST_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
AST_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
AST_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
AST_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."

BRA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Brazilian submarine Humaytá was ordered from Italy and delivered in the late 1920s. It was designed as a modified Balilla-class, which was designed as a deep-sea diver. It displaced nearly 1,400 tons and was armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes. "

BRA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Bahia class was a class of two British-built scout cruisers built for Brazil and delivered in 1910. The ships were heavily refit and modernized in the 1920s but were still a relatively obsolete design by the start of World War II. During the war, the cruisers primarily performed convoy escort duties."
BRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Minas Gerais was a class of two dreadnought battleships built by the U.K. for Brazil in the early 1900s. They were active during World War II but far too obsolete for any serious duty, instead being used as coastal defense ships along the Brazilian coast."

CAN_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Ottawa class was the Canadian designation for British G, H, and I class destroyers ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."

They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
NZL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Gambia class was the New Zeland designation for British Crown Colony-class light cruisers. These were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
NZL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Black Prince class was the Canadian designation for British Minotaur-class (or Swiftsure-class) light cruisers. These cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
NZL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers.

Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
NZL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."

Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
SAF_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
SAF_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."

SIA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Vilun-class submarines were four small coastal subs built in Japan for the Royal Thai Navy between 1936 and 1938. They displaced 370 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
SIA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Phra Ruang was a former British R-class destroyer that was sold to The Royal Thai Navy in 1920. The ship displaced just over 1,000 tons and was armed with three 120mm/45 QF Mk IV guns and four 533mm torpedo tubes. They had good speed, range, and reliability for their vintage."
SIA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Taskin class consisted of a pair of light cruisers built in Italy. They were launched in 1941 but were requisitioned by the Siamese navy in 1942. They were to become the Etna-class Italian AA cruisers of the Regia Marina but were never completed before the Italian armistice. They would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armor but would be fairly slow for a cruiser."
SIA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Sri Ayuthia class coastal defense ships were perhaps the last ships of this type built in the world, with both ships of the class built in Japan and commissioned for the Royal Thai Navy in 1938. The design was comparable to a small cruiser (or large destroyer) in size, to a battleship in speed, and to a heavy cruiser in armament. Its main guns were four 203mm/53 3-Shiki cannon. They were lightly armored compared to contemporary heavy cruisers."

SPR_submarine_1_desc:0 "The B class were the first submarines built within Spain for the Spanish Navy. The six ships of the class were commissioned between 1922 and 1925. They were designed as single-hulled ships, and consequently their reliability was subpar. They were medium-sized submarines, displacing over 550 tons. They were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes."
SPR_submarine_2_desc:1 "The General Mola class was a class of four Italian Archimedes-class submarines commissioned in 1934 and transferred to the Nationalists in 1937.

SPR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Spanish G-class submarines were a pair of German VIIC-class submarines licensed-built by Nationalist Spain. Only one was ever completed, however, and was not transferred to the Spanish Navy until 1947. The subs displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes. They had excellent speed and range, as the Type VIICs were the workhorse of the German submarine fleet."
SPR_submarine_4_desc:0 "The three submarines of the Spanish D class were all launched in 1944 and commissioned at various times after the war. All three were designed and built in Spain.

VIC_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized displacing around 600tons though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of four ships were each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
VIC_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (Project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale), a rather specific shipyard design of the previous classes."
VIC_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean-going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
VIC_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament was smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
VIC_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers were a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, with an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons and larger engines."
VIC_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament, as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
VIC_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse was that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
VIC_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy: very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
VIC_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection was considerably increased. Its AA armament was adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement was over 10,000 tons."
VIC_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improved upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
VIC_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships was a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They featured a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrowed elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
VIC_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament was distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provided the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
VIC_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would have provided a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."

YUG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The two Hrabri class submarines were originally laid down as British L-class submarines for the Royal Navy, but were sold and ultimately completed for Yugoslavia using a modified design in 1928.

YUG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Beograd class consisted of three destroyers built with French help. Two of the ships were built at Split, while the third was built in France. All three were based on the French L'Adroit-class destroyers and commissioned in 1939. They displaced 1,210 tons and were armed with four 120mm/43 Škoda guns and six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had excellent speed but below-average range."
YUG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Split was a heavy destroyer launched and completed in Yugoslavia. It was launched in 1943 but not completed until 1958, with a modified design. Its original design displaced 2,400 tons and was armed with five 140/56 Škoda guns in its main armament. Despite its size, it had excellent speed."
YUG_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The old German cruiser SMS Niobe was sold in 1925 to the young Royal Yugoslavian Navy and extensively rebuilt. Equipped with modern AA and the heaviest guns in the Navy, Dalmacija served primarily as a gunnery training ship."
